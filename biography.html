                        <p>Soprano Lisa Mulgrew, born and raised in Lethbridge, Alberta, completed her Bachelor of Music from the University of Lethbridge in the spring of 2012, studying with Dr. George Evelyn and Dr. Sandra Stringer Conlon.  Lisa is an alumna of the University of Western Ontario, where she completed her Master of Literature and Performance in Music 2015 under the tutelage of Todd Wieczorek. During her time at Western University, Lisa had the opportunity to play the Female Chorus in UWOpera's <i>The Rape of Lucretia</i>, as well as being a featured artist in their Opera Gala. She was also a finalist in the Maritsa Brooke's Concerto competition, and had the great honour of singing Mahler's Rückert-Lieder with the UWO Orchestra April 2015. Lisa’s international appearances have notably included performing the title role of <i>Madama Butterfly</i> with La Musica Lirica in Novafeltria, Italy, in the summer of 2015. Lisa is a roster singer for Cowtown Opera Company in Calgary, Alberta, and was featured in their latest Cowtown Cabaret production, <i>Prison Divas</i>, in February 2017. She is very much looking forward to returning for Cowtown Opera’s 2017/2018 season, and is excited to be involved in two Cowtown Opera productions, including the Canadian premier of <i>William Todd’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</i>.</p>
                        <p>Lisa recently returned from the Eckhardt-Gramatté National Music Competition in Brandon Manitoba, where, alongside composer, pianist, and friend Jesse Plessis, she was awarded third place in May 2017. Passionate about the genre, Lisa says <i>“It's the challenge and intricacies of contemporary music that really appeal to me; how it pushes the boundaries of the performer technically, musically, and emotionally, while trying to bring to life the intentions and ideas of the creator.”</i> Supporting emerging and Canadian composers, Lisa continues this love of curating and creating different recital programs through her work with the Lethbridge’s Centric Music Festival, and in an ongoing collaboration with composer and pianist Jesse Plessis.</p>
                        <p>Lisa is also a passionate advocate for music education and advancement. She has worked with the University of Lethbridge Opera Workshop as assistant director & conductor for their 2015 & 2016 seasons, and works with the University of Lethbridge Collaborative Ensemble class. Additionally, Lisa was Assistant Conductor for the University of Lethbridge Singers for 2016/17 Season, and currently sits on the University of Lethbridge Music Conservatory Advisory Committee. Lisa is a faculty voice instructor for the University of Lethbridge Conservatory of Music, where she is deeply involved with developing interactive musical education programmes that are accessible and engaging for young musicians, while also focusing on core technique development.</p>
